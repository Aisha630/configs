# üñ•Ô∏è My Custom Terminal Configuration

This repository houses my personalized terminal setup, encompassing Zsh shell configurations, Kitty terminal emulator settings, Neofetch system information display customizations, and a bespoke Oh My Posh theme. The objective is to achieve a harmonious blend of aesthetics, functionality, and performance for an optimized terminal experience

---

## üéØ Why Zsh?

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) (Z shell) is a powerful and highly customizable Unix shell that offers advanced features such as:

- Command auto-completion
- Syntax highlighting
- History search
- Enhanced scripting capabilities

I chose Zsh for its flexibility and modern features, making it an excellent choice for developers and power users.

---

## üöÄ Journey to the Current Setup

### Initial Setup: Oh My Zsh

Initially, I used [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), a popular open-source framework for managing Zsh configurations. Oh My Zsh provides a wide array of themes and plugins that enhance the terminal experience. Some key benefits of Oh My Zsh:

- Easy installation and management of plugins
- A large community with extensive resources
- Pre-configured themes for aesthetics and productivity

#### Why I Removed Oh My Zsh

While Oh My Zsh is great, I found it to be **too heavy** for my needs. Specifically:

1. **Slow Terminal Startup**: Oh My Zsh added noticeable delays to the terminal startup time.
2. **Redundant Features**: Many of its features were overkill for my use case, and I wanted a leaner setup.

---

### Extracting Essential Plugins

Before removing Oh My Zsh, I identified certain plugins that were invaluable for my workflow. For example:

- **`copyfile`**: A plugin for quickly copying file paths to the clipboard.
- **`copypath`**: A plugin for copying directory paths to the clipboard.

I manually copied these plugins into my custom plugins folder (`~/.zsh/plugins/`) and ensured they worked independently.

---

### Current Setup: Lean and Fast

After removing Oh My Zsh, I designed my `.zshrc` to include only the necessary plugins and features:

- Direct sourcing of plugins from a custom `~/.zsh/plugins/` directory
- Optimized aliases for frequently used commands
- Integration with tools like `fzf`, `neofetch`, and `oh-my-posh`

The result? **A terminal that is significantly faster without compromising on functionality.**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Features

#### Plugins

1. **Syntax Highlighting**:

   - Provides real-time syntax highlighting for commands.
   - Plugin location: `~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting`
2. **Autosuggestions**:

   - Suggests commands as you type based on your history.
   - Plugin location: `~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions`
3. **Copy File and Path**:

   - `copyfile`: Copies file contents to the clipboard.
   - `copypath`: Copies paths to the clipboard.
4. **History Substring Search**:

   - Allows searching through command history using substrings.
   - Plugin location: `~/.zsh/plugins/zsh-history-substring-search`

#### Aliases

- `c`: Clears the terminal.
- `n`: Runs `neofetch` to display system information.
- `fzf`: A powerful fuzzy finder with a preview feature (`bat`).
- `python` ‚Üí `python3` and `pip` ‚Üí `pip3`.

## üîß Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zsh-config.git
   cd zsh-config
   ```
2. Back up your existing `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
   ```
3. Link the custom `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   ln -s $(pwd)/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
   ```
4. (Optional) Customize the `ZDOTDIR` if you want to store the configuration in a custom directory:

   ```bash
   export ZDOTDIR=/path/to/this/repo
   ```
5. Restart Zsh or source the `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Variables

#### Environment

- `HISTORY_SUBSTRING_SEARCH_HIGHLIGHT_FOUND`: Customizes the highlight color for history substring matches.

## What is `.zprofile`?

The `.zprofile` file is executed during the **login** phase of a Zsh shell session. This makes it ideal for setting environment variables and configurations that need to be available globally, even when scripts or non-interactive shell sessions run.

In contrast to `.zshrc`, which is executed for **interactive** shells, `.zprofile` is best suited for login-specific setups.

#### How I Use `.zprofile`

In this configuration, `.zprofile` is used to set:

- **Environment Variables**: Global paths and variables that need to be consistent across sessions.
- **Initialization Commands**: Commands that should run only once when the shell starts as a login shell.
- **Custom `ZDOTDIR`**: Redirects Zsh to use a custom directory for its configuration files.

#### Example `.zprofile`:

```zsh
# Set ZDOTDIR to use a custom configuration directory
export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh"

# Add custom paths
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

# Initialize environment variables for tools like Homebrew
if [ -x /opt/homebrew/bin/brew ]; then
  eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
fi

# Set default editor
export EDITOR="nvim"

# Load the .zshrc explicitly
source "$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc"
```

#### Why Use `.zprofile`?

1. **Environment Setup**: Variables like `PATH`, `EDITOR`, or `LANG` are set once and globally.
2. **Compatibility**: Ensures non-interactive or script sessions also have the necessary environment variables.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps login-related configurations distinct from interactive shell settings.

#### Why Separate `.zprofile` and `.zshrc`?

Keeping `.zprofile` and `.zshrc` separate allows for cleaner and more maintainable configurations:

- **`.zprofile`**: Global setup for login shells, environment variables, and system-wide commands.
- **`.zshrc`**: Interactive shell configurations, such as aliases, functions, and prompts.

This separation ensures that login-only settings do not clutter the interactive session configuration and vice versa.

## **Oh My Posh**
